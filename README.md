# Shopping-Mall-system-C++
  In this project, I implemented a simple shopping mall in C++. The mall provides a soothing shopping experience for customers.The mall performs the creation of a set of different stores, such as a book store, a shoe store, an electronic games store, etc. The mall greets an arriving customer and allows the customer to shop at the mall. 
Some of the things a customer can do at the mall are: 
	Get a list of available stores 
	Get a shopping cart 
	Enter a store 
	Get of list of items available for sale at the store 
	Add items to the shopping cart 
	Proceed to checkout and purchase the items 
The project have one customer, three stores and five items for sale at each store.
